TODO: transition to Zermos.mainAfterLoad, Zermos.mainBeforeLoad, Zermos.mainUnload. This makes it so only 1 function is called when the page is loaded, and 1 when the page is unloaded. This makes it so that other functions can't be called when the page is not loaded yet, and makes it so that the page can't be unloaded when it's not loaded yet.
